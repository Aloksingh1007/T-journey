## 🧠 AI-Powered Analytics Features

### 1. **AI Trading Coach** (Personalized Mentor)
- Weekly AI-generated coaching sessions
- Analyzes all trades from the week
- Identifies your #1 strength and #1 weakness
- Provides specific action plan for next week
- Tracks progress on previous recommendations

**Example Output:**
```
"This week, you showed excellent discipline with 90% plan adherence. 
However, I noticed you're taking profits too early on winning trades - 
your average winner is only 1.2R while your average loser is 1R. 
Next week, try letting at least 2 trades run to 2R or more."
```

### 2. **Pattern Recognition AI**
Goes beyond basic patterns to find YOUR unique patterns:

- **Temporal Patterns**: "You trade better on Tuesdays and Thursdays"
- **Emotional Patterns**: "When you're CONFIDENT, your win rate is 75%, but when GREEDY, it drops to 35%"
- **Setup Patterns**: "Your best setups are breakouts with high confidence (8+)"
- **Time-of-Day Patterns**: "Your morning trades (9-11am) have 2x better performance"
- **Sequence Patterns**: "After 2 wins, you tend to overtrade (65% chance)"
- **Environmental Patterns**: "When well-rested, your win rate is 68% vs 42% when tired"

### 3. **AI Trade Predictor** (Pre-Trade Risk Assessment)
Before entering a trade, AI analyzes:

- Your confidence level vs historical accuracy

**Output:**
```json
{
  "riskScore": 7.5,
  "recommendation": "PROCEED WITH CAUTION",
  "reasoning": "You're on a 3-trade winning streak and feeling GREEDY. 
                Historically, this combination leads to 60% loss rate. 
                Consider reducing position size by 50%.",
  "suggestedAdjustments": {
    "positionSize": "Reduce to 0.5% risk",
